# ECDHE-encrypted-chat
This project implements a secure client-server console-based chat app. It uses ECDHE to establish a shared key, and Fernet for encrypted communication. The server is designed to handle multiple concurrent clients, thanks to multithreading. Multithreading also allows for two-way communication.
